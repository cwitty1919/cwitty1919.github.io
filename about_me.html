			<p>I am a senior at CU Boulder studying computer science and economics. My passion is to build software and databases that are easy to use and provide great value to my users. My areas of professional interest are software development and database administration. I have interned at Genscape and Scottrade and have professional experience in software development, database development, and natural gas analytics.</p>

		 <p>But there is more to my life than programming. My personal interests include music, guitar, rock climbing, martial arts, and travel. The pictures decorating my site are from Antalya, Turkey.</p>
