			<p>I am a graduate from CU Boulder with a Bachelor of Arts in computer science and economics. My passion is to build software and databases that are easy to use and provide great value to my users. My areas of professional interest are software development and database administration. </p> 

			<p>I currently work as a software consultant for SSP Innovations creating custom ArcGIS and ArcFM software solutions. I have interned for Genscape and Scottrade and have professional experience in software development, database development, and natural gas analytics. In my coursework, I have worked with apps made from javascript and Ruby on Rails.</p>

		 <p>But there's more to my life than programming. My personal interests include music, guitar, rock climbing, martial arts, and travel. The pictures decorating my site are from a trip I took to Antalya, Turkey.</p>
